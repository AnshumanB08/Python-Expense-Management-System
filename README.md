## üß© Problem Statement

Managing expenses across various categories like rent, food, and shopping can become chaotic without a proper tracking system. This project solves that problem by providing a user-friendly web interface to:

1. **Add and update expenses by date**.
2. **Visualize expenses by category** within a specified date range.
3. **Analyze monthly spending trends**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Project Overview (with Screenshots)

### 1. **Add/Update**
Users can add new expenses or update existing ones by selecting a date and entering the amount, category and an optional notes.
